abyssal_channel	Abyssal channels (also, deep-sea channels, underwater channels) are channels in Earth's sea floor. They are formed by fast-flowing floods of turbid water caused by avalanches near the channel's head, with the sediment carried by the water causing a build-up of the surrounding abyssal plains. Submarine channels and the turbidite systems which form them are responsible for the accumulation of most sandstone deposits found on continental slopes and have proven to be one of the most common types of hydrocarbon reservoirs found in these regions.
abyssal_fan	Abyssal fans, also known as deep-sea fans, underwater deltas, and submarine fans, are underwater geological structures associated with large-scale sediment deposition and formed by turbidity currents. They can be thought of as an underwater version of alluvial fans and can vary dramatically in size, with widths from several kilometres to several thousands of kilometres.

shetland_group	The Shetland Group is a unit of mudstone with relatively minor interbedded argillaceous limestones lying between the Cromer Knoll and Montrose groups in the Northern North Sea.
shoreface_depositional_environment	The shoreface (or underwater platform) on flat coasts encompasses in its narrow sense that area which is subject to the constant action of moving water. This means that the landward boundary between shoreface and beach is the line of the average low-water mark. 
siliceous_fossil	Siliceous fossils are fossils that have silica (SiO2) as the principal constituent.
silicoflagellates	Silicoflagellates or Dictyochales are a small group of unicellular heterokont algae, found in marine environments. In one stage of their life cycle, they produce a siliceous skeleton, composed of a network of bars and spikes arranged to form an internal basket. These form a small component of marine sediments, and are known as microfossils from as far back as the early Cretaceous.
siltstone	Siltstone is a clastic sedimentary rock that is composed mostly of silt. It is a form of mudrock with a low clay mineral content, which can be distinguished from shale by its lack of fissility.
skade_formation	The Skade Formation consists of fine to coarse grained, often shelly sandstone with subordinate beds of brown silty mudstones or siltstone.
skagerrak_formation	The Skagerrak Formation in the north Central Graben, in the South Viking Graben, and in the Outer Moray Firth outliers, mostly comprises a monotonous continental red-bed sequence of fluvial sandstones and subordinate thinly bedded siltstones and mudstones. In the south Central Graben, three distinctive mudstone units interdigitate with the sandstones, enabling the Skagerrak Formation to be subdivided into six widely correlatable sandstone and mudstone members.
slate	Slate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism. It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock.

stronsay_group	The Stronsay Group is characterized by a relatively sharp differentiation between a sandstone and siltstone dominated shelf succession and a mudstone-dominated basinal succession. On this basis, two formations are recognized: the Mousa Formation and the Horda Formation. These formations represent a considerable time-span, ranging from the early Eocene to the earliest Oligocene.

svarte_formation	The Svarte Formation consists of calcareous mudstones with interbedded argillaceous chalky limestones. In the North Viking Graben and East Shetland Basin, the proportion of limestone within the formation generally decreases northwards and away from contemporary high structures. The mudstones are typically medium to pale grey and occasionally micaceous, glauconitic and pyritic. The argillaceous chalky limestones are mainly white to medium grey deposited_in
tarbert_formation	The Tarbert Formation typically consists of grey to brown, relatively massive, fine to medium grained, locally calcite-cemented sandstone, with subordinate thin siltstones, mudstones and coals. The formation is lithologically variable across the East Shetland Basin, but in general is dominated by very fine to fine grained, bioturbated sandstone or, where bioturbation is less intense (usually higher in the vertical succession), by micaceous, parallel-laminated to hummocky cross-stratified, very fine to fine grained sandstone.

tidal_platform	Tidal platforms, similar to tidal flats, are coastal wetlands that form in intertidal areas where sediments have been deposited by tides or rivers.
tor_formation	The Tor Formation typically consists of homogeneous, white or pale grey, tan or pink chalky limestones. Locally, however, softer argillaceous chalky limestones are interbedded with the harder, purer limestones. Cored sections reveal the presence of beds of relatively porous, slumped and chaotically bedded chalky limestone; these are marked by low velocity peaks and by distinctive porosity and dipmeter log responses. These reworked facies comprise the main reservoir intervals in the oilfields of the Norwegian Central North Sea.
transitional_depositional_environment	The transitional depositional region between the continental depositional environment and the marine depositional environment.

The Triassic is the first and shortest period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic period is subdivided into three epochs: Early Triassic, Middle Triassic and Late Triassic.
triassic_period	The Triassic period is a geologic period and system which spans 50.6 million years from the end of the Permian Period 251.9 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period 201.3 Mya. The Triassic is the first and shortest period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events.

triton_formation	The Triton Formation consists largely of mudstones but a significant amount of anhydrite is present in the lower and middle parts, and some thin beds of buff or green dolomite occur in the upper part. The mudstones are mainly red and red-brown, but some grey-green beds are present and the top of the formation is predominantly grey-green. The anhydrite is white, grey or colourless and occurs in thin beds.
tuff	Tuff is a type of rock made of volcanic ash ejected from a vent during a volcanic eruption. Following ejection and deposition, the ash is lithified into a solid rock.Rock that contains greater than 75% ash is considered tuff, while rock containing 25% to 75% ash is described as tuffaceous.
turbidity-flow_deposit	Oceanic turbidity currents are sediment laden waters situated over sloping ground will flow down-hill because they have a higher density than the adjacent waters.  they often have a "snow-balling-effect", as they stir up the ground over which they flow, and gather even more sedimentary particles in their current. Their passage leaves the ground over which they flow scoured and eroded. Once an oceanic turbidity current reaches the calmer waters of the flatter area of the abyssal plain (main oceanic floor), the particles borne by the current settle out of the water column.
turbot_anhydrite_formation	The Turbot Anhydrite Formation is largely composed of anhydrite, but includes a widespread argillaceous unit (the Hake Mudstone Member) and local developments of carbonate. A few thin beds of argillaceous, mainly fine or medium grained sandstone have been recorded near its lateral transition to the Bosies Bank Formation. The anhydrite is typically white or pale grey, but is occasionally orange, pink or red, and it sometimes contains laminae of red or grey mudstone.

The mudstones and chalky mudstones are usually soft to firm, blocky, locally sandy and silty, micromicaceous, glauconitic, pyritic and carbonaceous. They are generally pale to dark grey in colour, but grey-green and red-brown colours also occur. Thin, but widespread units of black, laminated, non-calcareous mudstone are developed at two levels. The limestones are hard to soft, microcrystalline or argillaceous and locally microlaminated or sandy.

The anhydrite is generally described as white or yellowish white to pale grey, soft to hard, amorphous or massive and microcrystalline with sporadic argillaceous beds.
westoe_coal_formation	The Westoe Coal Formation is dominated by grey mudstones and silty mudstones, but contains varying proportions of seat earths, coal seams, and sandstone beds. Beds of dark grey or black marine mudstone form a minor component of most sections.
westray_group	The Westray Group is characterized by a relatively symmetrical basin fill, with no sharp differentiation into shelf and basin lithofacies; the greatest thicknesses occur in central parts of the North Sea Basin. Two formations are recognized: the Skade Formation, dominated by shelf sands, and the Lark Formation, dominated by basin mudstones. The succession shows an overall progradation, such that the shallow marine sandstones of the Skade Formation extend basinwards over mudstones of the Lark Formation.
whitehurst_group	The term Whitehurst Group is introduced for strata, mostly Namurian in age, that are broadly equivalent to the Bowland Shale and Millstone Grit groups. The terms Bowland Shale Formation and Millstone Grit Formation are formally defined here as the offshore lithofacies equivalents of these groups. The Bowland Shale Formation is composed of basinal mudstones, whereas the Millstone Grit Formation encompasses a range of turbidite, delta-slope, deltaic, and fluvial braidplain facies.
wick_sandstone_formation	The Wick Sandstone Formation consists of sandstones with interbedded siltstones and mudstones. The sandstones are very fine to coarse grained and pebbly, locally argillaceous and poorly sorted. They are pale grey to greybrown and dominantly consist of translucent to clear quartz. Glauconite grains, carbonaceous debris and lignite clasts are widespread. The sandstones are generally poorly consolidated, but very calcareous concretions are common and are marked on wireline logs by high velocity spikes. The mudstones and siltstones are similar to those of the Valhall Formation.
yoredale_formation	The Yoredale Formation is characterized by marine limestones and mudstones occurring within a dominantly deltaic association of mudstones, siltstones, sandstones, and occasional thin coal seams. The sandstone beds are white, pale grey, or pale brown, mostly less than 15m thick.
zechstein_group	The Zechstein Group is here divided into five formations. The Kupferschiefer Formation is retained for thin marine shales of the basal Upper Permian transgression. The Halibut Bank and Turbot Bank formations are renamed the Halibut Carbonate and Turbot Anhydrite formations, and are redefined. The Shearwater Salt Formation is introduced for the thick halites, polyhalites and subsidiary salts at the centre of the Northern Permian Basin. These salts have been so extensively mobilized by post-Permian halokinesis that their primary depositional sequence and thickness are generally unknown. The Bosies Bank Formation is introduced for Upper Permian clastic sections around the northwestern margin of the Northern Permian Basin.
zechsteinkalk_formation	The Zechsteinkalk Formation includes a wide range of carbonate lithofacies that accumulated in ramp, shelf, slope and basinal settings. In ramp, shelf, and slope sections, the Zechsteinkalk Formation is thickly developed and typically consists of two, broad facies. Firstly, pale grey-brown, hard, variably dolomitised, locally argillaceous and pelletoidal carbonate mudstones. These commonly pass up into carbonate grainstones, which are oolitic, pelletoidal and dolomitized.
