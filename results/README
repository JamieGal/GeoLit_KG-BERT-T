RESULTS FOR BASELINE AND KG-BERT-T

Baseline results:
Contains two csv files with resutls for TransE and DistMult

KG-BERT-T
1)  Contains five csv files with different experimentation results
2)  For GeoLit and GeoLit long, contains txt files for all experiments.
    Understanding the folder and filenames:
      e.g. 
          L_32_2_5
          
          L - GeoLit-Long (or S for GeoLit)
          32 - Train batch size
          2 - Learning rate
          5 - Epochs
          
      For individuals documents they also contain two additional numbers
      e.g. 
          L_32_2_5_19_60
          
          19 - Mean rank for this trial
          60 - 0.60, the Hits@10 for this trila
