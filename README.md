# GeoLit_KG-BERT-T

This repository contains the data and code needed to run experiments from:

KG-BERT-T FOR GEOSCIENCE: DOMAIN-SPECIFIC USE OF PRE-TRAINED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING MODELS FOR KNOWLEDGE GRAPH COMPLETION

MSc Data Science project 



Repository contains:

KG-BERT-T: full code (Google Colab) and best model outputs saved

baseline_models: TransE and DistMult baseline models (Google Colab) and grid search outputs saved

data_processing: geolit_processing (Jupyter Notebook) to build knowledge graph, extract triples and split dataset for model

geolit_data: data for models

knowledge_graphs: geolit.ttl and (updated) geolit2.owl knwoledge graphs

results: results of all models, including csv output and raw test output for GeoLit and GeoLit-Long
